The codes are for the following paper:

Cheng, Yuan and Xuehui Han. 2022. "Assessing the economic loss due to natural disasters from outer space" Climate Services 26: 100286.

Please cite the paper when using the codes. When using the data sources to replicate results, please also cite the following sources: 

The data source for nightlights is Earth Observation Group:

Procedure to run the codes:

First, download all the data to your local folder and use setwd() to set it as your working folder.

Second, Running the programs in numerical orders can roadshow empirical procedures. Programs started with 1 to 4 are for data organizing. Programs started with 5 are for regressions and can be run directly to generate the baseline regression results and selected robustness checks.
